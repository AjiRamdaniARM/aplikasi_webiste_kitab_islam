In compiling this book, Imam al-Baghawi originally placed hadiths without a chain of transmission and did not explain the source of their collection. Realizing this fact, Imam al-Tabrizi who was born several hundred years later took the initiative to rearrange these hadiths, placed a chain of transmission, stated the source of their collection and gave a few comments. This was stated by Imam Tabrizi himself in his introduction. This work was printed in various editions. Meanwhile, the work in the hands of the author is entitled Misykat al-Mashabih written by Waliyuddin Abu Abdillah Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Khatib al-‘Amri al-Tabrizi. It was published in 3 volumes in 2003 by Dar Kutub al-Ilmiah, Beirut, Lebanon and was authenticated by al-Syeikh Jamal ‘Ainaiya.',
