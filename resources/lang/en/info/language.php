    'p-desk-1' => 'The book Mishkat al-Masabih was compiled by Waliud-din Abdullah Muhammad bin â€˜Abdullah al Khatib al-Umari at-Tibrizi (d. 741 AH) or better known as Khatib al-Tibrizi. This book improves the shortcomings found in the book Masabih al-Sunnah by Imam Al-Baghawi (d. 516 AH).',
    'p-desk-2' => "This book can be <span class='poppins-bold text-[#E67E4D]'>compared to a summary of Sahih Bukhari </span> where the content is almost the same as the authentic one. What distinguishes the two is the number of hadiths that are more in Sahih Bukhari and also the status of the hadith. Readers of this book will be able to appreciate the demands of a Muslim's life based on the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Apart from that, the discussion is divided into several clauses according to the orientation of the content of the hadith, making it easier for the reader to make reference to any hadith they want.",
    'p-deks-3' => "The authors, namely Imam Baghawi and Imam al-Tibrizi, did not include only hadiths that were considered authentic in their books. This resulted in a mixture of hadiths that were weak and could not be used as evidence with authentic hadiths.",
    'p-deks-4' => 'Since to date there is still no digital application that focuses on the reference of the book Mishkat al-Masabih and the suitability of this book to be used as a virtual reference source, Elzar Shariah Solution Sdn Bhd as the project manager wants to develop a smart application or apps called <span class="poppins-bold text-[#E67E4D]">Masabih</span>  to make it easier for the community and Muslims in Malaysia, especially to obtain access and information on <span class="poppins-bold text-[#E67E4D]"> hadith and hadith fiqh </span> as well as answers to questions in life based on the relevant hadith directly and quickly.',
    'p-deks-5' => 'It is hoped that the Masabih Web and Mobile Application can enlighten the Muslim community about the importance of the hadith and sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad SAW, as well as being a guide and reference for the Muslim community as a whole. This application will be developed all at once and donated to the general public, it will be accessible and used for <span class="poppins-bold text-[#E67E4D]">FREE</span>  by the general public.',

    'MTP-JUDUL' => "PROJECT METHODOLOGY",
    'MTP-P' => "This project will use the library method. The book that will be used as reference material as the main information in the construction of the Masabih.com application is Midraj ul-Fawatih which is a rearrangement of the results of combining two of the world's leading hadith books that have been translated into Malay, namely Masabih al-Sunnah and Mishkat al-Masabih.",

    'MTP-LIST-4' => 'Appoint a hadith scholar to carry out takhrij on all hadiths under study. Translation, lectures, status and takhrij of more than 6000 hadiths is expected to take a year',

    // === language  paragrap === //
    'paragrap-1' => 'Because the implementation and launch period of this application takes a relatively short time, we as the project manager for the <span class="text-[#E67E4D] poppins-bold"> Masabih </span> application require a large amount of funds to ensure that this project can be implemented successfully.',
    'paragrap-2' => 'So far, our team has already started the task and around 5000 hadiths <span class="text-[#E67E4D] poppins-bold"> are ready to be translated and brief explanations </span>  are available. At this time, all lectures and translations have been included, while waiting for the results of the second and third layer of review. As soon as the second and third layer of review is complete, we will include the revised version on this website.',

        // === language kos pbr === //
    'p-pbr-language' => 'The proposed cost for this project is quite high considering that it was specially arranged by our company privately and several external developers with an estimate and target time to complete this project to be done within a year only. This requires a large number of developers and reviewers to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the process of making this website can run smoothly and quickly. The estimated total cost for this project is <span class="text-[#E67E4D] poppins-bold"> RM 512,000 </span> . However, when this website started to be browsed online, the total donation had only reached around RM 73,000 and we have already used the donation money involved to make this website and pay hadith experts and scholars for translations and lectures even though the funds are NOT sufficient.
